Zork is an interactive, story-driven text game
written in Java that uses a ternary tree data structure 
to create a dynamic and customizable storytelling experience. 
This code allows users to craft their own narrative adventures, 
where players can explore, make choices, and immerse themselves
in a world of their own design.
